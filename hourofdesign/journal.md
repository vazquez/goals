| July 15th, 2015  | I deviated a bit from my usual unscripted programming in favour of teaching others how to annotate their designs. It is something that our Design team has talked about recently, and I wanted to share what I had learned. Overall, good session!

| August 5th, 2015 | I partnered up with the [RideW/Me team](http://www.ridewit.me/) to help in designing a style guide. It was so much fun. [Here is the link to Episode 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWrvU0rwrwM)|
