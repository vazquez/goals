# Hour Of Design Journal

| Date  | What Happened? |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| July 15th, 2015  | I deviated a bit from my usual unscripted programming in favour of teaching others how to annotate their designs. It is something that our Design team has talked about recently, and I wanted to share what I had learned. Overall, good session!
