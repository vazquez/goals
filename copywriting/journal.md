| Aug 31, 2015  | I found this great article titled [The Day You Became a Better Writer](http://blog.dilbert.com/post/127310496506/the-day-you-became-a-better-writer-2nd-look). The article talks about the key to writing for clarity and persuasion. The article also gave me two great leads for books that speak about this topic: [God's Debris](http://www.amazon.com/Gods-Debris-A-Thought-Experiment-ebook/dp/B00HFYD8E4/ref=pd_sim_351_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=1YPHMYMFXWCC3DVG76SR) and [How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big](http://www.amazon.com/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still-ebook/dp/B00COOFBA4/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1376677690&sr=1-1).
