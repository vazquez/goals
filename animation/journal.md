August 17th, 2015  | After spending the weekend looking into it and researching, I have decided to dedicate my time to an open-source library called Framer.js. This means I'll have to get reacquainted with CoffeeScript and learn what Framer.js is all about. So far, it's looking so much fun. I already made a nice little prototype of a menu interaction. This would have taken me hours upon hours on AfterEffects, so I think it's the right move forward. For those of you who also wante to learn Framer.js, check out these resources that will get you started [0](http://www.darrinhenein.com/rapid-prototyping-part-one/) [1](http://framerjs.com/learn/basics/) [2](http://arcturo.github.io/library/coffeescript/01_introduction.html) [3](https://leanpub.com/coffeescript-ristretto/read#leanpub-auto-a-pull-of-the-lever-prefaces)
