August 17th, 2015  | After spending the weekend looking into it and researching, I have decided to dedicate my time to an open-source library called Framer.js. This means I'll have to get reacquainted with CoffeeScript and learn what Framer.js is all about. So far, it's looking so much fun. I already made a nice little prototype of a menu interaction. This would have taken me hours upon hours on AfterEffects, so I think it's the right move forward. For those of you who also wante to learn Framer.js, check out these resources that will get you started [0](http://www.darrinhenein.com/rapid-prototyping-part-one/) [1](http://framerjs.com/learn/basics/) [2](http://arcturo.github.io/library/coffeescript/01_introduction.html) [3](https://leanpub.com/coffeescript-ristretto/read#leanpub-auto-a-pull-of-the-lever-prefaces)
August 19th, 2015 | They say the best way to learn is to teach. I agree. To help me learn and teach others about prototyping and UI animations I created a [Framer JS Toronto](http://www.meetup.com/Framer-JS-Toronto/) Meetup group! I will use this Meetup as a place to help me get to a more comfortable place with this technology.
October 12th, 2015 | The first Meetup went great! I have scheduled the second meetup. I partnered up with HackerYou to offer a bigger space and a wider reach of audience. For our second Meetup, we will be exploring the Sketch and Framer Studio ecosystem.
