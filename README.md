# Goals
In the spirit of open everything, I want to share the goals I have set for myself with the help of [Cassie McDaniel](https://twitter.com/cassiemc). These long-term goals will inform how I wish to grow as a designer this year. 

I read a really great article the other day, this is an excerpt:

> If you read your long term goals every day you will think about them every day. If you think about them every day, and spend your days working toward them, theyâ€™ll manifest. [8 Things Every Person Should Do Before 8 A.M](https://medium.com/@benjaminhardy/8-things-every-person-should-do-before-8-a-m-cc0233e15c8d)

This is where I start.

## Hour of Design
The process of Design has historically been sheltered from the public. As such, we have lost a lot of visibility in regards to what it takes to go from empty canvas to pixel-perfect design. I decided to create a [YouTube Live Stream series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9MJ2wGfJ_7mbLN6rXjWztA) titled The Hour of Design. This was inspired by [Mike Conley's](https://twitter.com/mike_conley) excellent [Joy of Coding](http://mikeconley.ca/blog/category/technology/livecoding/) series. During my episodes, I share my screen and design live, with everyone as the audience. 
 
### Why?

The purpose of this event spans several objectives:

- Demistify the design process (within Mozilla and externally) and show that even the best designs always go through moments of hardships and challenges.
 - Open our design practice to individuals eager to design but unsure of where to start / what design is actually comprised of.
 - An opportunity to verbalize design decisions.
 - Share our work to the whole world!
 
So, in a nutshell, I want to help create an open design culture at Mozilla, mentor others in design, and personally to help me better verbalize my design decisions.

### By When

**Date:** December 31st, 2015

This will be an ongoing goal. I aim to air [one episode every week](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9MJ2wGfJ_7mbLN6rXjWztA) right through the end of 2015. I will analyze my audience and adjust my material accordingly.
