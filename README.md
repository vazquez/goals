# Goals
In the spirit of open everything, I want to share the goals I have set for myself with the help of [Cassie McDaniel](https://twitter.com/cassiemc). These long-term goals will inform how I wish to grow as a designer this year. 

I read a really great article the other day, this is an excerpt:

> If you read your long term goals every day you will think about them every day. If you think about them every day, and spend your days working toward them, they’ll manifest. [8 Things Every Person Should Do Before 8 A.M](https://medium.com/@benjaminhardy/8-things-every-person-should-do-before-8-a-m-cc0233e15c8d)

This is where I start.

## Hour of Design
The process of Design has historically been sheltered from the public. As such, we have lost a lot of visibility in regards to what it takes to go from empty canvas to pixel-perfect design. I decided to create a [YouTube Live Stream series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9MJ2wGfJ_7mbLN6rXjWztA) titled The Hour of Design. This was inspired by [Mike Conley's](https://twitter.com/mike_conley) excellent [Joy of Coding](http://mikeconley.ca/blog/category/technology/livecoding/) series. During my episodes, I share my screen and design live, with everyone as the audience. 
 
#### Why?

The purpose of this event spans several objectives:

- Demistify the design process (within Mozilla and externally) and show that even the best designs always go through moments of hardships and challenges.
 - Open our design practice to individuals eager to design but unsure of where to start / what design is actually comprised of.
 - An opportunity to verbalize design decisions.
 - Share our work to the whole world!
 
So, in a nutshell, I want to help create an open design culture at Mozilla, mentor others in design, and personally to help me better verbalize my design decisions.

#### By When

**Date:** December 31st, 2015

This will be an ongoing goal. I aim to air [one episode every week](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9MJ2wGfJ_7mbLN6rXjWztA) right through the end of 2015. I will analyze my audience and adjust my material accordingly.

#### Milestones

As of July 16th, 2015, I have aired 5 episodes :).

## Speaking

If anyone knows me, they know I talk a lot. I like sharing what I know and teaching others. At the beginning of the year, I became really interested in sharing my passion with others. I am a firm believer that everyone is a designer. We all make decisions, we all iterate, and we all create. As such, we need tools in our arsenal to help us elevate the practice of design.

My high-level goal is to speak about UI Design and Design Principles at conferences.

#### Why?

- Helps me organize and present my thoughts.
- Helps me become more of – and establish my reputation – as a thought leader.
- Allows me to bring back learned material to my team so we can collectively level up.

#### By When

**Date:** December 31st, 2015
**Number of talks:** By the date above, I must have accepted or delivered at least 2 talks a design and development conferences.

#### Milestones

Wohoo! I applied to speak at [CascadiaFest](http://2015.cascadiajs.com) and my proposal got accepted! On July 8th, 2015, I gave a talk on Microinteractions to a couple hundred developers, designers, and web enthusiasts.

I have submitted Call For Papers to several conferences, I'm hopeful to knock this goal out of the park!

## Animation

Motion, where smiles happen and surprise is born. Over the years, I've gotten comfortable in designing interfaces in various software programs. However, I have never approached the field motion design, perhaps out of fear. Whenever I look at motion studies or motion prototypes my heart always starts beating faster. It is so exciting to be able to prototype and visualize a concept. As such, I have endeavoured this year to start animating something. It will be very simple at the beginning, but I hope to be able to get to a point where I can animate an design interaction.

#### Why

- To improve the work within the Mozilla Foundatoin through microinteractions and higher fidelity designs.
- To get uncomfortable, and try something new.

####  By When

**Date:** October 31st, 2015

Maybe my end result could be something Halloween related!
