| April 2015 | Got accepted!
| May 2015 | Applied to speak at code.talks in Hamburg, Germany

| July 8th 2015 | Gave a talk on the Power of Emotion and Delight
| July 1 - 15 2015 | Applied to speak at UXDC and OSF Conference.
| Aug 5 2015 | Did not get accepted to Open Source Feelings (OSF) Conference. I will try again next year!
| Aug 6 2015 | Didn't get it for UXDC unfortunately. Record amount of speaking submissions made the selection process hard.
| Aug 6 2015 | Applied to speak at Forward Web Technology Summit 2016
| Aug 11 2015 | Applied to speak at O'Reilly Design conference, but didn't make the cut. It was a tough conference to get into, I admit. But always worth the try!
| Aug 12 2015 | I'm afraid I didn't get accepted to speak at Midwest UX Conference.
| Sep 1 2015 | I've been invited to give a guest lecture to George Brown Design students! The topic I was asked to speak about was wicked problems. Preparing for this lecture was challenging. Reading, researching, and writing were all on high alert. It turns out having material for 3-hours' worth of lecture is not easy. I now know how my profressors felt like!
| Sep 30 2015 | I want to give my Wicked Problems talk to others. I have submitted my talk to UXPA 2016 in Seattle and IXDA 2016 in Helsinki. Fingers crossed! Submitting to UXPA 2016 was an new experience for me as I had to review 5 other session proposals. It was quite nice to read other proposals.
